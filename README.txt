 1.0
This is the very first one-page website I made, learned a lot about all the very basic stuff while doing it.
It is screaming for an update though, cause it is quite ugly. I expect to work on 2.0 as soon as Im done with the front-end projects from FCC.
Made originally @CodePen.io: http://codepen.io/nicolasmdf/pen/wWwXWg.

 2.0
Redesign, very simple html+css only.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another iteration may or may not include: 
 -project screenshots as background imgs for their correspoding links.
 -parallax.
 -fancier stuff?
 -a short paragraph about myself.
I purposedly avoided all of the above to stick with a minimal design, but who knows...
